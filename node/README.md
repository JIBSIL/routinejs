## node folder

This folder contains a NodeJS implementation of routinejs

DOMs are fetched from a browser using Playwright Chromium

SimpleScript is fully supported, including adding new commands and a small set of existing ones. Check out SIMPLESCRIPT.md and the main README for a full updated list of commands.

### examples
Basic: example of accessing the components directly from JS. Since the JavaScript API is still in alpha, breaking changes may be pushed and the example may break as a result

Embedded: an example where SimpleScript code is embedded directly into the javascript container

File: the SimpleScript is read from a file.
